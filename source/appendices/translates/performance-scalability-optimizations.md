## Introduction

> Magento 2.0 was designed for the next era in eCommerce-to make it faster, easier and more cost effective than ever before to create shopping experiences that are tailored precisely to your business needs.

Magento 2.0 是专为下个时代设计的电子商务系统，让您比以往更快速、轻松，和更具成本效益地，完全根据业务需求为客户创建量身定制的购物体验。

> It all starts with a modern architecture based on popular frameworks and coding patterns that gives you full flexibility to meet virtually any business need with speed and agility. Magento 2.0’s modular design reduces application complexity and enables you to easily extend or customize core functionality with off-the-shelf extensions or your own code so you can bring innovative ideas to market fast. A built-in automated testing framework also speeds development and you can easily integrate Magento 2.0 with 3rd party solutions thanks to enhanced and efficient APIs.

基于流行框架和编码模式的现代架构使系统具有高度可扩展性，能快速、灵活地满足你的几乎所有业务需求。Magento 2.0 的模块化设计有效降低了应用复杂度，让你可以轻松地通过现成组件或编写代码来扩展和定制核心功能，从而将创意快速推向市场。内置的自动化测试框架可提高开发效率，通过强大高效的 API，你可以轻松地将第三方解决方案集成到 Magento 2.0。

> Magento 2.0 also offers new functionality to help you create powerful shopping experiences. An all-new, streamlined checkout and enhanced responsive designs provide you with an improved toolset for differentiating your site and growing sales across devices. Redesigned administrative controls and merchandising tools enable more efficient business operations and faster onboarding of new team members so you can deliver better service to your customers. And, with easier upgrades enabled by Magento 2.0’s modular architecture, you can immediately take advantage of new functionality as it becomes available.

> On top of this flexible and feature-rich new platform, Magento 2.0 also includes comprehensive changes that set a new standard for performance and scalability. Out-of-the-box, Magento 2.0 can now:
> - Process significantly more orders per hour on the same hardware
